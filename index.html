							<h2>Projects I've Worked on</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>Stars</strong> is a 3D snake game with educational elements.<br>
								In stars you start out as a small snake with 3 hearts. You need to try to survive as long as possible as you grow and not hit walls or yourself, while gathering coins, points & power-ups.
								Once you get a purple coin you are prompted with a question, answer it right you get a power-up, answer it wrong you lose a heart.<br><br>
								This was my first unity project. Made with free assets from the unity store.
								The goal for stars was to see what it would look like if I could grab an old arcade game and add educational elements to it, while adding my own spin to it.<br>
								Stars was developed solo within a month.<br>
								<a href="https://github.com/safi00/Stars">Github</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1Hm-Wdk2SNA11Mw-EMb__2pA361A8FGE0&export=download">Build</a>

							<p><strong>Atomic Center</strong> is a local multiplayer 3D educational board game.<br>
								In Atomic center you play as an astro-scientists trying to piece together the planet's forgotten periodic table. In this game you go around a game board trying to guess elements on periodic table.<br>
								Atomic Center can be played by 2-5 players, turn order is decided at the start of the game by rolling dice to see who rolls higher.
								Turn order is decided by highest to lowest. The game can be played alone but some dynamic mechanics would not be as harsh.
								The player uses 2 D6 dices to move around the board. As the player moves and lands on different tiles it has different prompts.
								You are not allowed to walk backwards; each time you pass the start you get a point.

								<br><br>
								Atomic Center is digitization of a board game I made. Made with free assets from the unity store.
								The goal for Atomic Center was to see what it would look like if I prioritized the educational elements first and then add gameplay.<br>
								Atomic Center was developed solo within 2 weeks.<br>

							<p><strong>Villa elektra</strong> is a 2D educational game.<br>
								In Villa elektra you play as a soon to graduate intern. you were commissioned to do you're next job at this villa but everything is a mess. In this game you play educational mini-games.<br>
								The mini games range from quizzes to math questions<br>

								Villa elektra was made by Edwin van Emst, The goal for Villa elektra was to teach & test havo students with elektro techniek knowledge.<br>
								We were tasked as a group of students to add a few more levels and port the game to be a browser game.<br>
								My tasks on villa elektra:<br>
								• Made level 7.<br>
								• Made level 9.<br>
								• Made meterkast (in-between level).<br>
								• Touch functionality for most of the over-world.<br>
								• An analog touch joystick.<br>
								• Added a menu option to play the levels individually, allowing players to play the game on touchscreen devices.<br>
								• Fixed bugs and bugs in the game that prevented the game from being converted into a web game (WEBGL), then made the entire game available as a web game.<br><br>

								Other minor additions were:<br>
								• Increased the level max to ten.<br>
								• Added entries to access my levels in the over-world.<br>
								• The pause screen shows newer levels and level scores.<br>
								• Made accounts on GitHub & itch.io, for the next people who were to work on it.<br>
								Villa elektra was worked on for 2 months.<br>
